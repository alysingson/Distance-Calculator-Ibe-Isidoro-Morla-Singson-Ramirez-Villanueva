# Distance Calculator
# This program calculates the distance between two points.

import math

# Get the coordinates of the two points from the user
x1 = float(input("Enter x1: "))
y1 = float(input("Enter y1: "))
x2 = float(input("Enter x2: "))
y2 = float(input("Enter y2: "))

# Calculate the differences between the coordinates
x_difference = x2 - x1
y_difference = y2 - y1

# Apply the distance formula
distance = math.sqrt(x_difference ** 2 + y_difference ** 2)

# Display the result
print("The distance between the two points is:", distance)
